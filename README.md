## Usage

To use this back-end application, fork the repository, clone the repository, or download the ZIP file to access the code for yourself. This will require you to have a text editor. I recommend Visual Studio Code, but there are a plethora of other options available.

Next, follow the Installation instructions below.

Then, open the `server.js` file in your text editor's terminal, and enter `node server.js`.

## Installation
1. Ensure node.js is installed. 
2. Ensure there is a `.gitignore` file (with `node_modules` and `.DS_Store` written inside) before installing any npm dependencies. 
3. Create a `package.json` file by entering the `npm init -y` command in the terminal. 
4. Use the following commands to install required dependencies:
* `npm i inquirer@8.2.4`
* `npm i mysql`
* `npm i mysql2`
* `npm i console.table`
5. Setup your sql files:
    1. Access the mysql terminal by using the command: `mysql -u <enter your username> -p`. Then type in your password when prompted.
    2. Run the following commands in the mysql terminal: 
        * `source db/schema.sql`
        * `source db/seed.sql`
